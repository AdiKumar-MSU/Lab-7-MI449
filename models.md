    In general, I found that the best AI model in Copilot that helped me out with this assignment was Claude, which seemed to have the most up-to-date version of Alpine's documentation, and understood Tailwind enough to where I didn't need to change the model's code each time I asked it for assistance. For instance, compared to ChatGPT 4o, which I found to be the least effective model, when I was trying to figure out if I could make one request to the DummyJSON API, Claude used Tailwind's syntax using $fetch() to get the API response, whereas ChatGPT did not.

    And, even though I did not end up using that solution, that to me demonstrated Claude 3.5 was a superior assistant model compared to ChatGPT 4o.
